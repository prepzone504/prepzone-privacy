# Data Deletion Instructions

This page provides instructions for deleting your personal data associated with the Prepzone mobile application, which uses Facebook Login for authentication.

## If We Do Not Store Your Data on Our Servers
Prepzone does not permanently store your Facebook data (name, email, profile picture) beyond what is needed for active sessions. Data is used only for authentication and app functionality.

To remove access and any associated data:
1. Go to your Facebook account settings: **Settings & Privacy > Settings**.
2. Scroll to **Apps and Websites**.
3. Find and select **Prepzone**.
4. Click **Remove App**.
5. Confirm removal.

This revokes access and deletes any temporary data we hold.

## Request Manual Deletion
If you believe we have any remaining data or want confirmation of deletion, email us at:  
prepzone504@gmail.com

Include your Facebook name/email used for login. We will confirm deletion within 30 days.

According to Meta Platform rules, we provide these instructions for user data deletion requests.
